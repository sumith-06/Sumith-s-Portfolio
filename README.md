# Sumith’s Portfolio

This is my "first project"— a personal portfolio website built to "practice and enhance my web development skills".  
It showcases who I am, my projects, and how you can get in touch with me.  

# It contains
- **About Me** section with introduction  
- **My Projects** section to showcase work  
- **Contact Me** section with a working form  
- Responsive layout for mobile and desktop  
- Clean & minimal design
